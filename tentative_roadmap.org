* Performance evaluation only
** TODO Replicate a transfer learning paper
One paper that Cecilia sent me uses ResNet + an SVM.
Instead we could try and solve the same task using ResNet and some Dense Layers.

** TODO Find a purely dense model for some task with an existing dataset
Jakob told me to try RNNs.
These are used for language modelling and other use-cases, where there are datasets and models available.

** TODO Evaluate performance for cutting at different layers
We want a graph that shows relative inference time increase over the number of layers moved into the enclave.

In this graph we could include a measure of "model privacy", ie. ratio of public parameters.
It could also be ratio of private parameters, or private/public parameters.


* Future usecase
This is the usecase I drew up for a new monetization scheme of MLaaS.
